# trusty-vault

A reimplementation of the Ansible &reg; Vault encryption (WIP) and decryption [specification](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#vault-format), wrapped in a simple CLI.

This CLI is a WIP and doesn't actually exist yet, see the nested [ansible-vault rust library](ansible-vault) for current progress on the implementations.
